Hello there, my name is Francesco Frattolillo. I'm currently a first year Ph.D. student from La Sapienza University of Rome.

I have a BSc degree in Computer Science at University of Naples Federico II and a MSc degree in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics at Sapienza University of Rome.

​
I am a very curious person and I try to stay up to date with recent technological advances.


I like challenging tasks that allow me to test my knowledge and in particular, Artificial Intelligence tasks (Reinforcement Learning, NLP, Computer Vision, Audio Processing, BCI, etc.) applied to real problems.

​

Outside of academic interests:

* I am a music lover and have played drum in the past

* I am a sporty guy, in recent years I have been practicing calisthenics

* I am passionate about videogames in particular the resident evil saga

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.--->
