<h1>Overview</h1>
<a href="https://github.com/nicofirst1/MAMBRL">code </a>

The idea of this project is to apply reinforcement learning model-based techniques to a Multi-Agent system.
The goal is that the agents try to learn a model of the environment while also learning their own policy.

This "synthetic environment" can be exploited in different ways according to the type of approach selected.


<h2>Problem Definition</h2>
Consider 'N' points on a 2D plane which need to be visited at least once by 'M' bots. Provide a path for all of the 'M' bots such that the total distance traveled by the bots is minimum.
